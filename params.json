{"name":"Doop Framework 101","tagline":"Tutorial site for PLDI 2015","body":"### What is Doop?\r\n[Doop](http://doop.program-analysis.org/) is a **declarative** framework for Static Pointer Analysis of Java programs. It provides a huge variety of analyses and also the surrounding scaffolding to run an analysis end-to-end (fact generation, processing, statistics etc).\r\n\r\nThe declarative nature of Doop stems form the fact that is uses **Datalog** (more specifically *LogiQL*, a Datalog dialog developped by [LogicBlox](http://www.logicblox.com/)) to specify an analysis.\r\n\r\nThe building blocks come in the form of **predicates**. Our facts (a.k.a *EDB* logic) are represented as such. E.g. `Person(\"John\")` or `Parent(\"John\", \"Johnny jr\")`.\r\n\r\nThen we have **rules** (a.k.a *IDB* logic) to infer new information from things already known to be true. This continues until no new information can be extracted. E.g.\r\n```\r\nAncestor(x, y) <- Parent(x, y).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n```\r\n$ cd tutorial_root_folder\r\n$ source environment.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Toy Example\r\nWe want to compute the ancestors for a set of people. Our rules (left-arrow notation) along with their type declarations (right-arrow notation) are in [ancestors.logic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plast-lab/doop-pldi15-tutorial/gh-pages/examples/ancestors/ancestors.logic). Our facts (a.k.a delta logic) are in [facts.logic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plast-lab/doop-pldi15-tutorial/gh-pages/examples/ancestors/facts.logic). The `+` operator in front of the delta predicates, denotes that we want to add facts to our database (we could also remove or update facts).\r\n\r\nWe invoke actions on our Datalog engine using `bloxbatch`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bloxbatch -db DB -create -overwrite               # create our database\r\n$ bloxbatch -db DB -addBlock -file ancestor.logic   # load our rules\r\n$ bloxbatch -db DB -execute -file facts.logic       # load our facts\r\n$ bloxbatch -db DB -print ancestor                  # print computed results\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
